# BitScoop Data Science Demo

You can build with any API on the BitScoop platform which makes being a software developer more interesting than ever.
In this demo, we demonstrate how to use Amazon Lambda to fetch daily statistics about your tech stack, store that data in an RDS box, and then analyze the data with Amazon QuickSight or something similar.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to use QuickSight (or something similar) to easily get deep insights into your software stack.

The [tutorial](./tutorial) folder contains instructions on how to set up a copy of this project on your own.
